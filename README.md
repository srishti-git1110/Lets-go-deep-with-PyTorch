# Learning Pytorch
First of all - PyTorch isn't a Framework!
It's a library having tensors as its core data structure providing an extensive set of operations on them via the torch module.

<br/>
With most of it written in C++ and CUDA, PyTorch provides high performance scientific computing with massive parallelism support.
